## To do

1. write a code book for all data files.
   1. code book must note that the AMP effects are absolute amp effects unless explicitly noted. only place this isn't used is the politics between groups AMP effects.
2. improve this readme with licenses, links to materials, etc.
3. or to d is making new confidence intervals when it could just extract the known ones from the OR. inspect the or to d implementation generally.
4. change plots in meta -
   1.  change raincloud to swap pos/neg and inf/non inf.
   2. better yet, swap for pred plot: trial type*influenced plots; they really illustrate the effect 
5. add raincloud plot of dem/repub inf/non inf AMP effects, with latter on x and former as coloring 
6. get exact p values for meta analyses
7. do moderator meta for cohens d comparisons, get exact p value
8. add plot of influence rate to meta section
   1. Add analysis of proportion that have influence rate below .25 given its non normal distribution?
9. add processing and analysis of the political amp exp 4 - currently only uses posneg



- re run all canonical processing and analyses prior to manuscript reporting checks
- Participant level IA-AMP effect ~ IA-AMP influence rate, and both IA-AMP trial level analyses should have 2 IA-AMPs for experiment 4. Each needs a multivariate meta analysis that includes the politics IA-AMP too.
- Correlate the aware and unaware trials political IA-AMP effects. Are they correlated well, and do both have decent distributions? We elsewhere show that the unaware trials effect is worse at separating known groups but can still do it. One response is that a unaware trials only AMP could be used in future as an implicit measure - but the question here is does it actually contain any additional or hidden information not in the aware trials? if its just a poorer predictor and is still correlated well with the aware trials effect then what is actually interesting about the implicit measure apart from the operating conditions that produced this effect?
  - More complicated: Correlate the 1) aware trials political IA-AMP effect, 2) unaware trials political IA-AMP effect, 3) aware trials generic valence IA-AMP effect, and 4) unaware trials generic valence IA-AMP effects. compare within-domain, between-awareness correlations with between-domain, within-awareness effects 
- Evaluate whether online/offline is needed, if so change to meta.
- Add meta analyses to OSF.
