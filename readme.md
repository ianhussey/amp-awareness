## To do

1. exp 4 analysis line 180: "Key effect: influence*prime_type interaction". is it? or is it the three way with party? change either OR to d code or description + plot.
2. does manuscript state that analyses are done on absolute effects, or that the participant level analyses only are done on these??
3. write a code book for all data files.
   1. code book must note that the AMP effects are absolute amp effects unless explicitly noted. only place this isn't used is the politics between groups AMP effects.
4. improve this readme with licenses, links to materials, etc.
5. square prereg with analyses re hypotheses numbers - at least exp 4 had some issues.
   1. exp 4 done, others to do

- re run all canonical processing and analyses prior to manuscript reporting checks
- Add meta analyses to OSF.
