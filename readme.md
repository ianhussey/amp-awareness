## To do

1. latest commit seems to have collided some issues - or to d changes and removal of abs() wraps need to be kept, plus whatever jamies changes were
2. or to d and abs() wrapper to be fixed in exp 4 analysis when jamie is done with that file
3. does manuscript state that analyses are done on absolute effects, or that the participant level analyses only are done on these??
4. integrate distribution analyses code into meta analysis
5. renumber meta analyses in code
6. write a code book for all data files.
   1. code book must note that the AMP effects are absolute amp effects unless explicitly noted. only place this isn't used is the politics between groups AMP effects.
7. improve this readme with licenses, links to materials, etc.
8. choose which plots to report in manuscript
9. add raincloud plot of dem/repub inf/non inf AMP effects, with latter on x and former as coloring 
10. cohens d comparions has a working method, add to exp 4
11. add plot of influence rate to meta section
    1. Add analysis of proportion that have influence rate below .25 given its non normal distribution?
12. square prereg with analyses re hypotheses numbers - at least exp 4 had some issues.
    1. exp 4 done, others to do

- re run all canonical processing and analyses prior to manuscript reporting checks
- Add meta analyses to OSF.
