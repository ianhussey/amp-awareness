## To do

1. need to examine distribution of bootstrapped ORs to decide if median or mean is more suitable.
2. why are there multiple levels to prime type??
3. propogate bootstrapping code to other analyses
4. absolute AMP effects or native? this needs checking for every analysis to square with the preregs.
5. influence_general is not that clear a name, rework in processing?
6. write a code book for all data files.
7. improve this readme with licenses, links to materials, etc.
8. add bootstrapping to exp 2
9. add exp 4
10. adjust processing for exp 3 - missing traditional AMP uninfluenced i think
11. update meta analysis





## completed tasks

- anonymisation
- standardization of processing for exp 1 and 2
