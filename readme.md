# Effects on the Affect Misattribution Procedure are strongly moderated by awareness

Development is done in this github. Archived files for distribution available on the OSF: [osf.io/gv7cm](https://www.osf.io/gv7cm)

Note that experiments are numbered 0 to 7 here but are labelled 1 to 8 in the manuscript. The replication (experiment 0 here) was run last and reported first in order to clarify the narrative. So, experiment N in manuscript = github experiment N + 1. The folders have not been renamed in order to make the git versioning easier to follow and avoid us having to rename a lot of the component files.
